# LTLMoP Revival: An Updated and Functional LTLMoP Repository


### Introduction
This repository contains a functional and updated version of the original LTLMoP (Linear Temporal Logic MissiOn Planner) toolkit, which can be found at https://ltlmop.github.io/. The original LTLMoP toolkit was an influential and widely-used tool for mission and motion planning using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). However, over time, the original repository faced challenges due to its reliance on Python 2 and deprecated packages.

Our goal with this project is to revive the LTLMoP toolkit by addressing the compatibility issues, updating dependencies, and ensuring its functionality in Python 2 environments. We have made efforts to bring this valuable tool back to life and make it accessible to researchers and practitioners in the field of robotics and planning.

### Key Updates
Here are some of the main updates we have made to the LTLMoP toolkit:

- Python 2 environment compatibility: We have maintained the codebase to be functional within a Python 2 environment, ensuring that the toolkit can be used by those who prefer working with Python 2.
- Updated dependencies: We have addressed the deprecated packages issue by replacing them with their modern equivalents or suitable alternatives, making sure that the toolkit works seamlessly in a Python 2 environment.
- Bug fixes: We have identified and resolved several issues that were causing the original LTLMoP toolkit to be non-functional. Our updates have restored the toolkit's functionality, making it suitable for practical use.

### Installation and Usage
To install and use the updated LTLMoP toolkit in a Python 2 environment, please follow the instructions provided in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file. This file contains comprehensive guidelines for setting up the toolkit in your environment and resolving any potential dependency issues.

### Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to further improve and expand the capabilities of this updated LTLMoP toolkit.
