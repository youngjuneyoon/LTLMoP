### As you install..

For the most part, follow along [installation guide](https://github.com/VerifiableRobotics/LTLMoP/wiki/Installation-Guide) of LTLMoP.
However, as the Installation guide is also a little outdated, make sure to refer the information here as you follow the installation guide of LTLMoP.

This codebase is based on Python2. Make sure you install Python2. **For MacOS**: Homebrew no longer supports Python 2 by default. You may need to install Python2.

Useful (and critical) commands for Mac Users:
```
arch -x86_64 python2 -m pip install wxPython==4.0.7.post2
pip2 install Polygon2
python2 -m pip install scipy
python2 -m pip install pyserial
sudo python2 -m pip install matplotlib
```

Other deprecated codes are handled (replaced/fixed).
